# Memory-Game

## What is a Memory Game
This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons. 
Green- matching
Red-   not matching


## Challenge
Match all the pair of cards in less time with less moves.


## Instructions for user
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time


## How I built this Memory Game
Manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* created a pop-up to show when player wins the game
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
